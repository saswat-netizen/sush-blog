            Hello, gorgeous souls! 💕 I&apos;m Sush - a woman who&apos;s lived fully, loved deeply, and wandered widely. After decades of collecting experiences across continents, cultures, and life chapters, I&apos;m here to share the wisdom, wonder, and authentic moments that make this journey so beautifully complex. ✨
          </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-pink-700">My Story</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-pink-800">
          At 35+, I&apos;ve been blessed to call multiple countries home, build a successful career in international business, navigate the beautiful chaos of relationships, and discover that the most profound adventures often happen in the quiet moments between destinations. From corporate boardrooms in Singapore to sunrise yoga in Bali, from heartbreak in Paris to healing in the Himalayas - every experience has shaped the woman I am today.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-pink-700">The Wisdom I&apos;ve Gathered</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-pink-800">
          Through years of solo travel, career pivots, cultural immersion, and personal growth, I&apos;ve learned that true luxury isn&apos;t about expensive things - it&apos;s about experiences that enrich your soul, products that genuinely enhance your life, and the confidence that comes from knowing yourself deeply.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-pink-800">
          Life is not about collecting passport stamps or Instagram moments - it&apos;s about collecting wisdom, connections, and experiences that transform you. Every recommendation I share has been tested in real life, every travel tip earned through actual adventures (and misadventures), and every insight gained through years of conscious living. This is authentic storytelling from a woman who believes in living fully and sharing generously.
